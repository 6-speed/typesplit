# typesplit
A command to separate files into folders by file extension and by month.

I haven't built this yet but it's on the todo list.

logtail.c included, which details active console standards.

This will be a menu-based command to allow for dynamic display in the console.

It also means that templates built with symbolic links or text links are required.

These templates can include a special self-fill script that allows backups to be copied, sheared and thinned.

It is therefore a tool for saving space and consolidating, and also renaming file sets with extra information.
